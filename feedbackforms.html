        <h2>Feedback from Kyan Jeuring</h2>
        <p>
            During the Sunny Socks project I noticed that you were keen to learn new thing and always 
            asked someone questions when you didn't understand something. I remember that we were working
            online with each other for 3 hours and you would ask me to explain the code I was writing.
            I got the feeling that you wanted to deliver the best quality you could provide to the project 
            and even if you didn't know how to begin you would go to someone and ask for advice. 
            I think that your way of learning new things by asking people is a great habit, however sometimes 
            try to search the answer on the internet. You might get better results on the internet than your classmates can provide you.
            Keep asking questions and strive to learn new thing, that's the way to a good career.
